Python Project Repository
This repository contains three Python projects focused on data analysis, machine learning, and utility functions. Each project is designed to enhance Python skills in different domains, including statistical modeling, data exploration, and image processing.

Project 1: Linear Regression
Description
The Linear Regression.py project implements a simple linear regression model to predict a target variable based on a single feature. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of the regression line and data points. This project demonstrates foundational machine learning concepts using Python.

Files
Linear Regression.py: Contains the code to perform simple linear regression on a dataset.
sample_data.csv: Sample dataset file used for training the model (not included here but should be a CSV file with two columns: one feature and one target).
Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Setup & Usage
Ensure all required libraries are installed. Install them via:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the script with the sample dataset:
bash
Copy code
python Linear Regression.py
The program will output a scatter plot of the data points with the regression line, along with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Project 2: Data Analysis
Description
The Data Analysis.py project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. It includes data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of trends and patterns. The program is designed to provide insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Files
Data Analysis.py: Contains functions for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
dataset.csv: Sample dataset file (not included here, but you can use any CSV file with multiple columns).
Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Setup & Usage
Make sure the required libraries are installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Run the script with your dataset:
bash
Copy code
python Data Analysis.py
The program will generate visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) and summary statistics to help you understand data distribution and relationships.
Project 3: Image Converter
Description
The Image Converter.py project provides a simple utility to convert image files from one format to another (e.g., PNG to JPEG). It uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle image conversions and supports various formats like PNG, JPEG, BMP, and TIFF.

Files
Image Converter.py: Script for converting image files between formats.
sample_image.png: A sample image for testing (optional).
Libraries Used
PIL (Pillow)
Setup & Usage
Install the Pillow library if it's not already installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install pillow
Run the script with the source and destination file paths as arguments:
bash
Copy code
python Image Converter.py source_image.png output_image.jpg
The program will save the converted image in the specified format.
Conclusion
This repository provides a diverse set of projects that illustrate key skills in data analysis, machine learning, and utility programming. Each project includes practical applications of Python libraries and aims to build proficiency in handling real-world tasks.
